## About the Book
Oracle GoldenGate is a software product that allows you to replicate data from one database to another. If you are interested in using Oracle GoldenGate Microservices (OGG MA) in HUB configuration for database upgrade, migration, and data replication, then this book is a valuable resource for you.

This book provides a step-by-step guide for designing and implementing an Oracle GoldenGate Microservices architecture in a hub configuration, with high availability (HA) and disaster recovery (DR) capabilities. It begins by explaining the architecture of Oracle GoldenGate Microservices, and then provides real-world examples of how it can be used to upgrade or migrate databases, replicate data, and monitor the environment. Moving on, the book includes detailed instructions on how to install and configure Oracle GoldenGate Microservices, as well as, how to use the REST API, command line, and web interface to manage the solution. Lastly, the book provides a practical example of how the architecture can be used to achieve HA and DR for data replication.

By the end of the book, you will be a confident and knowledgeable OGG MA user, who is able to design, implement, and manage Oracle GoldenGate Microservices Architecture solutions for your organization.
